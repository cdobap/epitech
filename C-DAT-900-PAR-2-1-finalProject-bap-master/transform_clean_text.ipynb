FED\\'S WILLIAMS WHEN ASKED ABOUT THE DEBT CEILING: THE TREASURY MARKET IS AT THE HEART OF THE WORLDWIDE FINANCIAL SYSTEM, AND ITS FAILURE TO FUNCTION HAS GLOBAL RAMIFICATIONS. FED\\'S WILLIAMS: I AM OPEN MINDED ON THE QUESTION OF A CENTRAL BANK DIGITAL CURRENCY AND THE FED HAS TO ANSWER BIG QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW IT WOULD SOLVE PROBLEMS IN SOCIETY AND MAKE PAYMENT SYSTEMS OR THE ECONOMY MORE COMPETITIVE. FED\\'S WILLIAMS: SOME SUPPLY AND DEMAND MISMATCHES MAY PERSIST UNTIL NEXT YEAR. FED\\'S WILLIAMS: I EXPECT INFLATION TO DROP SIGNIFICANTLY NEXT YEAR, TO ABOUT OR AROUND 2%.

FED\\'S BRAINARD: WE DON\\'T KNOW WHEN THE PRICING CONSEQUENCES OF THE EPIDEMIC WILL SUBSIDE. FED\\'S BRAINARD: ALTHOUGH THE DEBT CEILING IS NOT ACTUALLY A FED CONCERN, CONGRESS MUST \"STEP UP\" AND HANDLE IT. FED\\'S BRAINARD: IT\\'S DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT IF OTHER MAJOR CENTRAL BANKS ADOPT DIGITAL CURRENCIES, THE US WON\\'T FOLLOW SUIT. FED\\'S BRAINARD: STABLECOINS, IF WIDELY EMBRACED, POSE A THREAT. FED\\'S BRAINARD: GIVEN THE SHIFT TO CONTACTLESS PAYMENTS AND THE CHALLENGES OBSERVED IN DIRECT PAYMENTS TO HOUSEHOLDS DURING THE EPIDEMIC, THE DEBATE OF THE FED DIGITAL DOLLAR IS MORE SALIENT NOW. ECB\\'S DE COS: THE REDUCTION OF THE ECB\\'S MONETARY SUPPORT MUST BE DONE WITH CAUTION. FED\\'S BRAINARD: WHEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES ARE RIGHT, MACROPRUDENTIAL MEASURES LIKE THE APPLICATION OF A COUNTERCYCLICAL CAPITAL BUFFER SHOULD BE CONSIDERED.
